## Root-in!
Root-in! is an AI-powered platform that connects international
students with the resources they need to make the tough
transition of moving to another country for study.
The system employs a RAG database of local resources about
housing, including helpful advice regarding establishing mobile
service and other pro-tips that students wish they had known when
they first came to the US.
Root-in! uses ChatGPT Assistants API to use information gathered
from a webUI about the studentâ€™s needs and preferences, uses RAG
search to provide the best meaningful answers, and serve them to
the students who need them in easily consumable formats to aid
their transition to the States.
## Architecture
1. Frontend and backend was developed using vanilla JS, scalable to adopt any other JS framework
2. Backend implemented the OpenAI SDK to connect to their API and create custom AI Assitant along with a custom RAG for the File Search# Duke-AI-Hackathon
